# NexuJS Project

This is a **Nexu** project bootstrapped with [nexujs-cli]().

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) by default.

You can modify the routes and API endpoints in the routes directory. The server will auto-reload when changes are made.

## Updating Dependencies

To keep your project up to date with the latest versions of its dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm run update
```

This will automatically update all dependencies to their latest versions.

## Changing Default Configuration

If you need to change the default configuration for your NexuJS project, you can do so by modifying the `nexu.config` file. This file allows you to customize various aspects of the project, such as port settings, middleware, routes, and more.

For more information on configuration options, refer to the [NexuJS Documentation](https://github.com/Kingrashy12/nexu/blob/main/packages/nexujs/README.md#configuration).
